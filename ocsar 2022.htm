            <p>The 2022 Academy Awards had a little of everything: comedy, drama, action – and<br>
                that was during the live portion of the ceremony itself. It was a welcome return to a <br>
               hosted event, the three and a half hours didn’t feel like three and a half hours, and,<br>
                overall, it was one of the best Oscar telecasts in some time. There were a few quirks: <br>
               playing ‘Africa’ by Toto when Daniel Kaluuya and H.E.R. came out to present was<br> an 
               odd choice, to put it politely. However, as a celebration of film and the casts and <br>
               crews of the year’s nominations, it succeeded, with acceptance speeches that were<br>
                inspirational, joyful, and simply great. Here’s the best of the night.</p>
